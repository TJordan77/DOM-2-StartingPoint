# DOM II Assignment

EDIT: Hold left click and drag the mouse to color in cells. Hold right click and drag to erase them.



This is the starting point for the DOM II assignment. On your team, pick one person to be the owner of the repo.

That person will "fork" this repository. Then, they will add the other members of the group as collaborators.

The others in the group should check their emails (or GitHub notifications) for that invitation, and accept it.

Everyone should copy the URL of the forked repo and clone it on their machine, like so:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/DOM-2-StartingPoint
```

## Notes on Collaboration

As you are collaborating on this project, make sure you are regularly keeping main up to date:

```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

This is a great opportunity to create a GitHub Project and break the assignment down into smaller tasks. Push to feature branches and submit Pull Requests.

Please note that if you submit a Pull Request (PR) to a forked repo GitHub will assume you want to submit a PR to the base repo, rather than the repo your teammate added you to. You can easily change this when creating your PR, but it's a common mistake.
